### Reason for this project:
________

We were asked to create a website for a restaurant to help them cope through a global pandemic, by boosting their online sales and presence. 

We were asked to create the project using everything we have learned so far in HTML, CSS and Javascript.


## What did we do:

On the home page there is a timer that starts a countdown based on the given opening and closing hours of the restaurant. When the countdown reaches 0, a new text appers saying "We are open".

On the opening hours page, there is a timetable which has a border-left which turns red or green based on whether the restaurant is open or close on the day the site is visited.

On the menu page, we have a list of all the food items our restaurant has available, and we have made it so that when you scroll down, you do not scroll through the whole page, but just the food items. You will see this because the background image stays static the whole time. Moreover on this page, there is a search bar functionality, and a search will disply only the food items that match your input.


### What did we learn from this experience:

We got a taste of how to work in a team on a project, which will definitely help us prepare for problems in future collaborations.

We revisited many of the things we have learned in JS such as *timeouts*, *regex* and *dates*. At the same time we got a refresher of *HTML* and *CSS* which was great because it had been a while since we last used these tools.


## Problems encountered:

We learned what a shitshow Github can be when we do what should be a 1 person project. Since we were multiple people working on the same file and the same task (such as creating and styling the menu page), it creates a lot of conflicts, some that we could only resolve using the command line. This is because we all started with the same common html, css and js files, and later some of us renamed the files, hoping to avoid any conficts. Oh the irony...

We also did not manage to make a functional shopping basket. We tried using the bulma modal preset on the last day of the project, but unsuccessfully. 

We are having soe troubles with making the search bar work. If you search for something on the search bar, it will return the food that matches your input text, but the layout of the page will change and the background image cuts abruptly before the end of the page, which we have not figured out how to fix.


### Conclusion
_____

We created a basic restaurant website with 3 functional pages; **home**, **menu** and **opening hours**.
